# SpawnTrackerAPI

### An everquest discord bot / restAPI

SpawnTrackerAPI is a discord bot / FastAPI that launches both with asyncio. This app is the 'backend' for my LogParser app.

The goal of this app is to listen for fetches, which are made when the LogParser finds certain regex matches. Mob death, mob spawn, etc. Allows the discord channel to monitor upcoming mob spawns, alerts for spawns / deaths, etc.
